MACHINE LEARNING CLASS 2011
---------------------------
Introduction
============
Machine Learning Stanford classes offered at http://ml-class.org/. Using [`GNU Octave`](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/).

Honor Code
==========

The old course info page said:

> For the programming exercises, you are welcome to discuss them with
> other students, discuss specific algorithms, properties of algorithms, etc.;
> we ask only that you not look at any source code written by a different
> student, nor show your solution code to other students.
>
>   -- Professor Andrew Ng & The ml-class Team

Repositories
============

I used multiple repositories, one for the initial setup and slides and one for each assignment.
